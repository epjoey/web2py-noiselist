Introduction
============
This package is meant to be used as part of a course covering several python web
frameworks being taught in person. This will be the core code for making a simple
TODO list.

To get this sample app framework up and running::

 > git clone git@github.com:eleddy/web2py-noiselist.git
 > cd web2py-noiselist
 > python bootstrap.py # use the non-local python if you are on mac osx please
 > ./bin/buildout
 > ./bin/web2py start

That will get the basic instance up and running. These instructions will be updated 
as they get tested and the tutorial is expanded.

Have fun and ask lots of questions!
